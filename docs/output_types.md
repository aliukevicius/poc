# Output Types

Output types are about ways we present the data to the user.

Output types are defined in a JSON format.

Output type can have multiple output formats. Maybe? Maybe not?

Output format examples:
- JSON
- XML
- CSV
- HTML
- PDF
- HTML Form

Output can be for a single record or for a list of records.

Each output type will have its own API endpoint.

Each output type belongs to a content type.

Output type can display a partial record.
Each field in an output type will have a render widget for a given format. So maybe one output type can only have single output format?
